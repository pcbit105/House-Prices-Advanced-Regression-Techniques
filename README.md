# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
This is a machine Learning project for predicting housing prices. The dataset is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview). The dataset includes features such as zoning, neighborhood, surface area, year and month sold, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, garage type and quality, state of front porch, etc. Algorithms used are SVR, CatBoost Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. I used a Voting Regressor as an ensemble algorithm to combine the aforementioned algorithms. The final Y test dataset yielded an RMSLE score of 0.12787.
